<h1>Unit 1: Basics of The Web</h1>

<b>The Web</b>

<p>
  -The Internet or 'Web' is essentially a 
  collection of HTML documents which forms the 
  basis for everything on the web.<br>
  
  <br>-HTML = Hyper Text: Mark-up Language<br>  
  
  <br>-The internet came to life in the 90's 
  (thanks to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee>
  Tim Berners Lee</a>)<br>

  <br>-Any variety of file types can be found
  on the web, i.e. plain text, HTML, music,
  video etc. However, HTML & HTTP are the 
  glue that holds it all together.<br>

  <br>-HTTP = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
  The primary protocol of the web.<br>

  <br>- The Main components of the web are 
  comprised of the following basic elements: 
  A User, User Machine (i.e. personal computer/device)
  running a browser, The Internet, HTTP and 
  Servers.<br>
  
</p>

<br><b>HTML</b><br>

<p>
  -HTML is the heart of the web and is built
  from text content, markup, and references to
  other documents i.e images, and links to 
  other pages.<br>
  
  <br>-HTML Markup is a facet of HTML used
  to modify text in HTML docs. Two types of
  tags have been introduced so far in this
  lesson:<br>
  
  <br><b>Opening Tag:</b> <"Name"><br>
  <b>Closing Tag:</b> <"/Name"><br>
  
  <br><b>eg.</b> <"Name">Contents <"/Name"><br>
  
  <br>- The 'structure' which is composed of 
  an opening tag, contents and closing tag
  is known as an <b>Element</b>.<br>
  
  <br>-An HTML document is comprised of a series
  of elements.<br>
  
  <br>- HTML tags can be nested (i.e. successively 
   incorporated within each other).<br>
  
  <br>- HTML attributes can be added within a
  tag. The format of the attribute within a
  tag is as follows:<br>
  
  <br> <"tag" attr = "value"> contents <"/tag"> <br>
  
  <br>-There are a variety of tags, those
  introduced in the 1st lesson include; Anchor 
  (used for inserting a hyperlink), Image 
  (used for linking to an image or graphic),
  Bold (used for bolding text), Break Line
  (used to start a new line of text), Paragraph
  (used for segmenting a body of text).<br>
  
  <br>*Note: Both Break Line and Image tags
  belong to a category of tags referred 
  to as Void tags. This means they <em>
  do not</em> require a closing tag. This 
  is because Void tags contain no content.<br>
  
  
  <br>-There are two main categories of tags
  introduced in the 1st lesson: <b>Inline</b>
  & <b>Block.</b><br>
  
  <br>-Inline elements such as the Break Line tag
  are strictly text based, they are generally
  used at te end of a line of text to break up 
  and better organize a string of text<br>
  
  <br>-Block elements such as the Paragraph tag
  create an invisible perimeter or box 
  around the text which they enclose. The 
  dimensions of the perimeter around a 
  paragraph of text have parameters including 
  height and width which can be adjusted.<br>
  
  <br>There are  two additional elements introduced 
  in the 1st Lesson known as 'Span' and 'Div'.
  Span is an inline element, Div is a block 
  element. Both elements do nothing other 
  than contain their content.<br>
  
  <br>*Note:Attributes can be applied to both
  Span & Div elements.<br>
